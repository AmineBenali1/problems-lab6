(results of one output)

1. Random insert/delete

ArrayList: 105 ms (faster)
LinkedList: 984 ms (slower)
Reason:
ArrayList shifts elements in memory but random insertions/deletions are rare here and the array is contiguous -> faster for moderate sizes.
LinkedList must traverse the list to reach a random position -> O(n) -> much slower.

2. Sequential insert/delete at start/end

ArrayList: 222 ms (slower)
LinkedList: 3.5 ms (faster)
Reason:
ArrayList: inserting/removing at start requires shifting all elements -> O(n).
LinkedList: addFirst(), addLast(), removeFirst(), removeLast() : O(1) -> very fast.

3. Random access (get)

ArrayList: 18.6 ms (fast)
LinkedList: 489 ms (slow)

Reason:
ArrayList: direct index access in an array -> O(1).
LinkedList: must traverse nodes one by one -> O(n) -> much slower
